# TODOs

- When the car is switched off and on, then the remote doesn't work anymore.
  Is the reason on the car or on the remote?
- The sonic sensors are really flaky.
  E.g. when approaching a wall, the back sensor also starts to show something, which it souldn't.

- Add safety stop back, directly on the car.
  For case when remote gives us a wrong signal / somebody interferes
